/* IC has the standard control statements: assignments, method calls, return statements, if
constructs, while loops, break and continue statements, and statement blocks, rules:

1. The type of the updated location must match the type of the evaluated expression.
For integers and booleans, the assignment copies the integer or boolean value.

2. The break and continue statements must occur in the body of an 
   enclosing loop in the current method.

output: (first rule violation)
semantic error at line 27: the operator + is undefined for the argument types int and boolean
