/* Unary and binary operators include the following: 

1. Arithmetic operators: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /, and mod-
ulo %. The operands must be integers. The plus operator + is also used to concatenate
strings. Division by zero and modulus of zero are dynamically checked, and cause
program termination.

2. Relational comparison operators: less than <, less or equal than <=, greater than >,
   and greater or equal then >=. Their operands must be integers.

3. Equality comparison operators: equal == or different !=. The operands must have the
   same type. For integer and boolean types, operand values are compared. For the other
   types, references are compared.

4. Conditional operators: short-circuit \and" &&, and short-circuit \or" ||. If the first
   operand of && evaluates to false, its second operand is not evaluated. Similarly, if the
   first operand of || evaluates to true, its second operand is not evaluated. The operands
   must be booleans.

5. unary operators: sign change - for integers and logical negation ! for booleans

output: (4th rule violation)
semantic error at line 36: the operator && is undefined for the argument types A and A
