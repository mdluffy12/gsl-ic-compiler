/* Classes are collections of fields and methods, rules:

1. The extends clause is optional.

2. Only one class can be inherited, hence IC supports
   only single inheritance
   
3. Classes can only extend previously defined classes.

4. class cannot extend

   itself or another class defined later in the program.

5. Method overloading is not supported: A class cannot have multiple methods with the
   same name, even if the methods have different number of types of 
   arguments, or different return types.
   
6. Hidden fields are not permitted either

7. All of the newly defined fields in a subclass must have 
   different names than those in the superclasses.

8. However, methods can be overridden in subclasses. Subclasses can 
   re-define more specialized versions of methods defined in their 
   superclasses.
