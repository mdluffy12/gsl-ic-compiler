/* For each program, there is a hierarchy of scopes consisting of: the global scope, class scopes,
method scopes, and local scopes for blocks within each method, rules:

1. When resolving an identifier at a certain point in the program, the enclosing scopes are
   searched for that identifier.

   
2.Each class has a static scope and an instance scope. The instance scope is the set of all fields and methods of that class; 

3. the static scope is the set of static methods only.
