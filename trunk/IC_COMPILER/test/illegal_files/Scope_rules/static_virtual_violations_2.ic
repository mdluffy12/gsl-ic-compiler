/* For each program, there is a hierarchy of scopes consisting of: the global scope, class scopes,
method scopes, and local scopes for blocks within each method, rules:

1. When resolving an identifier at a certain point in the program, the enclosing scopes are
   searched for that identifier.

2. Fields and methods, both static and virtual, can be used either directly (without the dot prefix) if the
   current class contains those fields or method
