/* There are two kinds of method calls: static and virtual, rules:

1. At each method invocation, the number and types of actual values of the call site must be
   the same as the number and types of formal parameters in the method declaration.

2. values returned by return statements must agree with the corresponding return types
   from method declarations.

3. If a method is declared to return void, then return statements in
the body of the method cannot return values.

4. if the method is declared with a return type T, 
   then all return statements must return values of type T.
